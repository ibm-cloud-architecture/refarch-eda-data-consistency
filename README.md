# EDA - Data Replication

This repository includes scripts and sample test code to support Mirror Maker 2 labs.

Updated 9/28/2020.

To learn more about Mirror Maker 2, see our summary in [this note](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/refarch-eda/technology/kafka-mirrormaker/).

## Event Streams on Cloud to local cluster

The lab instructions are in [this note](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/refarch-eda/use-cases/kafka-mm2/lab-1/).

## Using Mirror Maker 2 from Event Streams on premise to Event stream on cloud 

The lab instruction are in [Kafka Mirror Maker 2 - Lab 2](/use-cases/kafka-mm2/lab-2/)

## Local cluster to Event Streams on Cloud

The goal is to demonstrate the replicate data from local cluster to Event Streams on IBM Cloud running as managed service. The two scenarios and the step by step approach are presented in [this note](https://jbcodeforce.github.io/kp-data-replication/local-to-es).

We have also documented the replication approaches from Event Streams as a Service to local cluster in [this note](https://jbcodeforce.github.io/kp-data-replication/es-to-local).

## Monitoring

For Event stream monitoring see [this article](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/refarch-eda/use-cases/monitoring-on-cloud/#event-streams-monitoring).

Fr Event Streams on OCP see [this note](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/refarch-eda/use-cases/monitoring-on-ocp/).
